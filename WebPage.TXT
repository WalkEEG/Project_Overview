### This is WalkEEG
WalkEEG is an open source system of [Brain-Computer-Interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface).

It is designed for developing science research and providing high tech 'toy' for Makers.

### Why WalkEEG?
You may know [Neurosky](http://www.neurosky.com/zh-Hans/default.aspx) or [Emotiv](http://www.emotiv.com/).

But they aren't open source. Therefore scientist or maker can not revise it to adopt their own design or application.

WalkEEG is opensource, both hardware and software. Furthermore, we provide recommended [BCI headset design](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:139725) for 3D-print.

### Authors and Contributors
We are group of people gathered at [Chaihuo Maker Space](http://www.chaihuo.org/) in Shenzhen. Most of the members are from [SZDIY](http://szdiy.org/) or a medical entrepreneur team called 'NOCI'. Others are attracted by this project. We have different background, scientist, engineering, mechanician, financial analyst, student, designer, seller......

I really don't know how these people can do what a work finally, but the collision of thought really caught my imagination.

So I put this project onto [Github](https://github.com/WalkEEG). We need more people to helping us!
