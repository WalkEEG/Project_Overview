{"name":"WalkEEG","tagline":"Open Source Brain-Computer-Interface","body":"### This is WalkEEG\r\nWalkEEG is an open source system of [Brain-Computer-Interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface).\r\n\r\nIt is designed for developing science research and providing high tech 'toy' for Makers.\r\n\r\n### Why WalkEEG?\r\nYou may know [Neurosky](http://www.neurosky.com/zh-Hans/default.aspx) or [Emotiv](http://www.emotiv.com/).\r\n\r\nBut they aren't open source. Therefore scientist or maker can not revise it to adopt their own design or application.\r\n\r\nWalkEEG is opensource, both hardware and software. Furthermore, we provide recommended [BCI headset design](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:139725) for 3D-print.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n[Github repository](https://github.com/WalkEEG)\r\n\r\n[Evernote shared note](http://goo.gl/v1xJOU)\r\n\r\n[Google Group](walkeeg@googlegroups.com)\r\n\r\n### LICENCE\r\nAll hardware design are licence by [CreativeCommons:Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)\r\n\r\nAll software are licence by [GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nWe are group of people gathered at [Chaihuo Maker Space](http://www.chaihuo.org/) in Shenzhen. Most of the members are from [SZDIY](http://szdiy.org/) or a medical entrepreneur team called 'NOCI'. Others are attracted by this project. We have different background, scientist, engineering, mechanician, financial analyst, student, designer, seller......\r\n\r\nI really don't know how these people can do what a work finally, but the collision of thought really caught my imagination.\r\n\r\nSo I put this project onto [Github](https://github.com/WalkEEG). We need more people to helping us!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nEmail:billyuqizhang83@gmail.com\r\n\r\nPhone:0086-13316960680\r\n\r\nAddress:Chaihuo maker space--Room 227, Bld A5, North Loft, Nanshan District, Shenzhen City","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
