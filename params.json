{"name":"WalkEEG","tagline":"Open Source Brain-Computer-Interface","body":"### This is WalkEEG\r\nWalkEEG is an open source system of [Brain-Computer-Interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface).\r\n\r\nIt is designed for developing science research and providing high tech 'toy' for Makers.\r\n\r\n### Why WalkEEG?\r\nYou may know [Neurosky](http://www.neurosky.com/zh-Hans/default.aspx) or [Emotiv](http://www.emotiv.com/).\r\n\r\nBut they aren't open source. Therefore, scientist or maker can not revise them to adopt their own design or application.\r\n\r\nWalkEEG is opensource, both hardware and software. Furthermore, we provide recommended [BCI headset design](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:139725) for 3D-print.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n[Github repository](https://github.com/WalkEEG)\r\n\r\n[Evernote shared note](http://goo.gl/v1xJOU)\r\n\r\n[Google Group](walkeeg@googlegroups.com)\r\n\r\n### LICENCE\r\nAll hardware design are licenced by [CreativeCommons:Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)\r\n\r\nAll software are licenced by [GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nWe hack at [Chaihuo Maker Space](http://www.chaihuo.org/) in Shenzhen.We are a team ,Most of us are from [SZDIY](http://szdiy.org/) or a medical entrepreneur team called 'NOCI',and others are attracted by this project.
